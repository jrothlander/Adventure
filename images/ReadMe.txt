I have started playing around with upgrading the sprites for the retro skinned game.

A few of the images are from Alex's Assets: https://alexs-assets.itch.io/16x16-rpg-item-pack
The knight is originally from https://free-game-assets.itch.io/free-fantasy-knight before I modified it... removed the sword so we can find and pickup the sword.
