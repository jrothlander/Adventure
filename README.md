# Adventure
Atari Adventure (1980) Clone

This is a clone of Warren Robinett's 1980 game Adventure for the Atari 2600 and written in HTML and JavaScript, and  my submission to Andre LaMothe's Udemy course,  Fast and Furious Game Development with JavaScript and AI.

## Controls
Use your keyboard cursor arrows to move the player and the spacebar to drop items. 

## History
Adventure was the first graphical adventure game ever released. Robinett was the first game developer to add multiple screens/rooms to computer game, the first to add an Easter egg, mazes, and a map to travel from room to room, and the first to use hyperplane navigation. Many games that came afterwards were inspired by Adventure and many game developers have mentioned that this game was their inspiration.

## Assets Supported
The player, dragons, keys, sword, gates, maze, bridge, magnet, microdot, hyperplane navigation, chalice, and winning the game are all working pretty much as the original. I do have it setup so that you have to drop the chalice to win and I do not lock the game down on winning, as I want you to be able to explore the maze.
